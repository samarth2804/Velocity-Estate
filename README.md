# Briefing

**Velocity-Estate** is a modern real estate web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It provides a platform for users to search, list, and explore various properties, whether for sale or rent. The application offers a user-friendly interface, advanced search options, and a seamless user experience. The objective of this project is to connect home buyers to sellers and tenants to renters directly to facilitate services including home trading and residential leasing without the intervention of local real estate agency as mostly they add no value to the transactions but substantially cost for both parties.
